JavaScript and CSS minifier/compressor tool

In order to minimize the number and size of HTTP requests for JS/CSS content,
this script combines multiple JS/CSS files into a single file and compresses it.

For caching issues, it appends a timestamp with each minified file it creates,
and writes it in separate text file, which can be further read to render latest 
JS and CSS file with markup.
